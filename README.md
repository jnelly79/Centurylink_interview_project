# Centurylink_interview_project
# Synoposis

Worked on a project for Centurylink for the second round of my interview process. Was asked to take data on the game FIFA, provide an EDA and compare Japan players to the rest of the players of the game, an OLS model predicting the feature "overall" for players who didn't have the data, and finally a model of my choice (decision tree) to predict on the missing feature data "nationality" whether if players were of the United States or not.
